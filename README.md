# Hey there!

I'm Semen Katz and I'm studying web dev at [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/ "Yandex.Practicum"). For many years I worked as a professional photographer. While developing my first portfolio website, I became very excited in the development process and loved coding. Finally I realized, that I want this to be not just a hobby but a hard skill and probably my next job.  

My stack consists of **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and also HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, Foundation.

I speak Russian, English and study Hebrew. Iâ€™m interested in contemporary art and culture, love to explore specialty coffees and brew approaches and have a guilty pleasure of organizing stuff (big fan of Notion, Google Apps etc.)  

For now, I'm looking for opportunities to improve my skills in JS and React and to explore other frameworks. I'm open for volunteering. Don't hesitate to reach me with any proposals.
