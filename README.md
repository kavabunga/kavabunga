For many years I worked as a professional photographer. Now web dev excites me much more and I'm studying it at [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/ "Yandex.Practicum").  

Iâ€™m interested in contemporary art and culture, love to explore specialty coffees and brew approaches and have a guilty pleasure of organizing stuff (big fan of Notion, Google Apps etc.)  

### My technology stack is:  
**HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Jest**, **Git**, **Foundation**
