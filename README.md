# Hey there!

I'm Semyon Katz and I'm in the begining of web dev career. For many years I worked as a professional photographer. While developing my first portfolio website, I became very excited in the development process and loved coding. Finally I realized, that I want this to be not just a hobby but a hard skill and probably my next job and graduated from [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/ "Yandex.Practicum").

I speak Russian, English and study Hebrew. Iâ€™m interested in technology, science, contemporary art and culture, love to explore specialty coffees and brew approaches and have a guilty pleasure of organizing stuff (big fan of Notion, Google Apps etc.)  

For now, I'm working on variuos pet- and non-commercial projects and looking for other opportunities to improve my skills in TS and React and to explore other frameworks. I'm open for volunteering. Don't hesitate to reach me with any proposals.
