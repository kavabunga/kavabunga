# Hey there!

I'm Semyon Katz, a frontend developer and photographer. Graduated from Moscow Technical Communications University. Having spent many years as a professional photographer shooting stories for Forbes, my journey took a turn when I delved into creating my first portfolio website. The excitement of the development process made me love coding and realize that this wasn't just a hobby; it was a skill I wanted to master and perhaps turn into my next profession. Subsequently, I successfully graduated from [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/ "Yandex.Practicum").

My tech stack comprises:

Fluent in Russian and English, I am also studying Hebrew. My interests span technology, science, contemporary art, and culture. I revel in exploring specialty coffees and various brewing approaches, and I have a guilty pleasure in organizing things (a devoted user of Notion, Google Apps, etc.).

Currently, I am engaged in diverse freelance projects, seeking opportunities to enhance my skills in TypeScript, Next.js and React, while also exploring other tools. I am open to volunteering for NGOs and welcome any proposals you may have.
